# Flight-fare-prediction

Flight Ticket Fares are, now-a-days, very difficult to predict. The prices change every minute we browse. There are different sites from where we can book our tickets but these sites work in the same manner. Only difference is that they have different offers to provide.

Most of the population worldwide prefer using Flight as their mode of travelling because it saves time but at a greater cost. These days one cannot say that if we book tickets early, we get tickets at a reasonable price. Sometime ticket prices depends on the airlines we use, the date of journey, source station, destination, travel route, time of departure, duration of flight, total number of stops and on some additional info/services provided by the airlines.

The given dataset is a supervised learning Regression dataset with 10683 records of passengers (rows) and 10 features (columns). The labelled column (target) here is the price column.

Based on these previous records, we have to build a model which can predict the future prices of the tickets and help travelers choose the best priced Airline for their future trips which can be cheaper for them.

The goal of the project are as follows:
1.  Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data set.
2.  Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.
